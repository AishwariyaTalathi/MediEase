The purpose of this android application is to make the life of patients a little easy. The areas covered in the project include Image Processing, Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing. They’ll be used for getting patient information and suggesting the patient a “good” hospital based on analysis of the reviews posted by users online. The data will be coming through Google Places API/Yelp API. The patient uploads his/her prescriptions via camera (OCR) and has the option to set alarms/reminders for them. Sentiment analysis will be performed on Amazon Web Services and the server will have endpoints for the application to exchange data. Workflow -

1)Patients log into the system (Google/Facebook/Email login).

2)They then upload their prescription/medical history via an image.

3)Medicine intake reminder using Cloud Messaging.

4)Patients can locate nearby hospitals.

5)Suggest nearby hospitals using Natural Language Processing
